# Introduction

This project consists in creating a small fractal exploration program. Where you can zoom-in and out, move the image, change colors, etc. It wa used the MinilibX provided by 42 School. We redered here Mandelbrot and Julia set, and Tricorn only in the bonus program.

# How to Use

* Clone the repo ```git clone https://github.com/vtrevisa/Fract-ol```
* Enter the ***Fract-ol*** directory
* Run **make** for a simplified program or **make bonus** for the complete project.
* Run ```./fractol <Fractal Name>```. For julia set pass both parameter after the fractol name. Ex.: ```./ fractol Julia -0.543 0.8```.

# Commands

* At the mandatory part:

    Zoom on center (in and out) = Mouse wheels.
    Exit = "Esc" key.
 
* At the bonus

    Zoom at the mouse position (in and out) = Mouse wheels.
    Move = Arrow Keys.
    Change Color =  'Q' and 'E' keys.
    Change Parameters = Right and Left click (only for Julia set).
    Exit = "Esc" key.
